## 📱 About the Project

**BMI Calculator** is a mobile application built using **Flutter** that helps users calculate their **Body Mass Index (BMI)** based on height and weight inputs. The app instantly classifies the result into standard health categories such as **Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese**.

The application focuses on **clean UI, simple user flow, and accurate calculation logic**.  
UI structure and interaction patterns were designed by **following common BMI app prototypes and standard mobile UX practices**.

## 🧠 What is BMI?

Body Mass Index (BMI) is a value derived from a person’s weight and height. It provides a simple indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for a given height.

---

## 🧮 How BMI is Calculated

BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) × Height (m))



### Example:
If a person weighs **68 kg** and has a height of **1.72 m**:



BMI = 68 / (1.72 × 1.72) ≈ 23

## 📊 BMI Categories (Adults)


| BMI Range | Category |
|----------|----------|
| Below 18.5 | Underweight |
| 18.5 – 24.9 | Normal / Healthy |
| 25.0 – 29.9 | Overweight |
| 30.0 and above | Obese |

## 🏥 Why BMI is Used


Doctors and health professionals use BMI for:
- Evaluating diet and physical activity
- Assessing cardiovascular and health risks
- Estimating body fat levels


---


## ⚠️ Health Risks


### Risks of Overweight:
- High blood pressure
- Type 2 diabetes
- Heart disease
- Gallbladder disease
- Sleep apnea and respiratory issues


### Risks of Underweight:
- Malnutrition and anemia
- Weakened immune system
- Osteoporosis
- Fertility issues
- Growth and development problems


---


## ❌ Who Should Not Rely on BMI


BMI may not be accurate for:
- Athletes and bodybuilders
- Pregnant women
- Elderly individuals
- Young children


This is because BMI does not differentiate between muscle mass and fat.
